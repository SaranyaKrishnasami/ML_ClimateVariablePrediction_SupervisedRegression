Modeling Steps:

1) Acquire Dataset
  Ensure the dataset is well-sampled and representative of the ML task you are tackling. Identify appropriate metrics to evaluate model performance.
2) Perform Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  Check for Null Values: Identify and handle missing values through imputation to maintain data integrity.
  Categorical Features: Label encode or one-hot encode categorical features for better model compatibility.
3) Feature Engineering
  Feature Scaling: Normalize features, especially for distance-based algorithms, to ensure consistency (e.g., meters vs. kilometers).
  Feature Selection: Apply techniques like regularization or dimensionality reduction to enhance model performance and reduce overfitting.
4)Create Baseline Model: Develop a simple model to set a performance baseline for comparison.
  Train and Test Models: Evaluate different models using the test dataset and select the best-performing one.
  Document the Modeling: Keep detailed records of model development processes, including decisions and results.
  Prepare Pipelines: Design and implement pipelines to integrate the model into the application seamlessly.
