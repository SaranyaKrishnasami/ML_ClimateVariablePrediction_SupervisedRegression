Machine learning models are algorithms designed to perform inductive analysis on data, aiming to derive general conclusions from specific data inputs.

This process involves supervised regression analysis using both parametric and non-parametric models. The data provided by the business is cleaned and sampled appropriately for regression analysis. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) plays a crucial role in this process, where the data is thoroughly examined to identify patterns and anomalies.

A baseline model is then constructed using linear regression, which is refined through data transformation techniques to meet the underlying assumptions. The detailed analysis and modeling approach, including various models such as linear models, shrinkage models, tree models, and neural networks, are documented in the report.
